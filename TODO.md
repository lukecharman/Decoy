- Store the endpoint with a GQL request (if type is signature)
- Get the GQL Integration test finished.
- Battle-test the GQL implementation a bit more.
- Make Decoy have the idea of a “standard” set of mocks which are checked first to avoid repetition / huge mocks.
- Document how drift solves itself because the Codables will fail if the data in the mock mismatches the code in the app.
- We need a way to pass flags – copy what we did for Appium with launch args, be sure it works with both flagging libraries.
- Make a GraphQL Example with a proper Apollo schema for some public GQL API.
