/// An Apollo interceptor that integrates the Decoy mocking framework into the request chain.
///
/// `DecoyInterceptor` is designed to be used within Apollo's interceptor chain to intercept GraphQL
/// requests. It attempts to fulfill requests from Decoy's stub queue to enable offline or mocked responses.
/// If a stub is available for the request, it returns the stubbed response immediately without performing a network call.
/// If no stub is available and Decoy is in `forceOffline` mode, it fails the request.
/// Otherwise, it allows the request to proceed to the network and, if Decoy is in `record` mode,
/// records the live response for future stubbing.
///
/// This interceptor enables seamless switching between live network requests and stubbed responses,
/// facilitating testing, offline support, and response recording for GraphQL operations.

  /// Intercepts a GraphQL request to provide a stubbed response from Decoy's queue or proceed with a live network request.
  ///
  /// The interception logic follows these steps:
  /// 1. Attempts to convert the Apollo `HTTPRequest` to a `URLRequest` and generate a `GraphQLSignature` from it.
  ///    If this fails, the request is completed with an error.
  /// 2. Queries Decoy's stub queue for a stub response matching the generated signature.
  ///    - If a stub is found:
  ///      - Validates that the stub contains data.
  ///      - Parses the stub data into a JSON object.
  ///      - Constructs a `GraphQLResponse` from the operation and parsed JSON.
  ///      - Parses the response into a `GraphQLResult` and completes with this stubbed result.
  ///    - If no stub is found and Decoy is in `forceOffline` mode, completes with a `stubNotFoundInForceOfflineMode` error.
  /// 3. If no stub is found and not in `forceOffline` mode, allows the request to proceed to the network.
  ///    - Upon receiving a live response:
  ///      - If Decoy is in `record` mode:
  ///        - Converts the live response to JSON data.
  ///        - Attempts to obtain an `HTTPURLResponse` from the response or creates a default one.
  ///        - Generates a signature for the request and records the response data and metadata via Decoy's recorder.
  ///      - Completes with the live response.
  ///    - If the network request fails, completes with the encountered error.
  ///
  /// - Parameters:
  ///   - chain: The interceptor chain managing the flow of request processing.
  ///   - request: The Apollo HTTP request representing the GraphQL operation.
  ///   - response: An optional HTTP response from earlier interceptors.
  ///   - completion: A closure invoked with the final result of the request, either a `GraphQLResult` or an error.
